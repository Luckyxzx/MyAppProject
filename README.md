# Indivudla Project
 University Of Southwales Science Mobile Application

The project uses MvvmHelpers which is created by James Montemagno https://www.nuget.org/packages/Refractored.MvvmHelpers

Collection of MVVM Helpers such as ObservableRangeCollection, BaseViewModel, Grouping, and others.

It's a better version of MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel) and it's a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls. https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Model-View-ViewModel
